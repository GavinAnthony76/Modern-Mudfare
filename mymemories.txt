WINDOWS SETUP (PowerShell):
1. Initialize Evennia:
   cd Modern-Mudfare
   evennia --init mygame

2. Copy custom files:
   Copy-Item -Path "server\typeclasses\*" -Destination "mygame\typeclasses\" -Recurse -Force
   Copy-Item -Path "server\world\*" -Destination "mygame\world\" -Recurse -Force
   Copy-Item -Path "server\commands\*" -Destination "mygame\commands\" -Recurse -Force

3. Update settings (append to mygame\server\conf\settings.py):
   BASE_CHARACTER_TYPECLASS = "typeclasses.characters.Character"
   BASE_ROOM_TYPECLASS = "typeclasses.rooms.Room"
   BASE_OBJECT_TYPECLASS = "typeclasses.objects.Item"
   START_LOCATION = "floor1_approach"
   SERVERNAME = "Journey Through Scripture"
   CMDSET_CHARACTER = "commands.default_cmdsets.CharacterCmdSet"
   TELNET_PORTS = [4002]
   WEBSERVER_PORTS = [(4003, 4004)]
   WEBSOCKET_CLIENT_PORT = 4004

4. Initialize database:
   cd mygame
   evennia migrate

5. Create superuser:
   evennia createsuperuser

6. Start server:
   evennia start

7. Connect:
   Web: http://localhost:4003
   Telnet: localhost 4002

8. Build world (in-game):
   @py from world import build_world; build_world.build_all()

LINUX/MAC SETUP:
Run automated script:
   ./setup_evennia.sh

Then follow steps 4-8 above.

====================
CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:
====================

FIX 1: ObjectParent Import Error
Problem: ImportError: cannot import name 'ObjectParent'
Solution: Added ObjectParent class to typeclasses/objects.py
Code:
   class ObjectParent:
       """Parent class for all objects. Required by Evennia's exits.py"""
       pass

FIX 2: Portal Startup Timeout
Problem: Ports 4000/4001 conflicted
Solution: Changed to ports 4002/4003 in settings.py

FIX 3: Syntax Errors in npcs.py
Problem: Multi-line strings not properly formatted (lines 236, 283)
Solution: Changed all multi-line dialogue to single-line or triple-quoted strings

FIX 4: Duplicate World Objects
Problem: build_all() ran multiple times creating duplicates
Solution: Added reset_world() function to clean up before rebuilding:
   @py from world import build_world
   @py build_world.reset_world()
   @py build_world.build_all()

====================
TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:
====================

PROBLEM: Server won't start
SOLUTION: Check if ports 4002/4003 are free
   netstat -ano | findstr "4002"
   If in use, change ports in settings.py

PROBLEM: World build fails
SOLUTION: Check Python mode import
   @py
   from world import build_world
   build_world.build_all()
   quit()
   Every new @py session requires reimport

PROBLEM: Duplicate objects
SOLUTION: Reset world
   @py from world import build_world
   @py build_world.reset_world()
   @py build_world.build_all()

PROBLEM: Can't find rooms/objects
SOLUTION: Use search
   @find <partial name>
   @py from evennia import search_object
   @py obj = search_object("<name>")

PROBLEM: Teleport not working with room name
SOLUTION: Use room number
   @find approach
   @tel #778  (use the number shown)

PROBLEM: NPCs not responding
SOLUTION: Check NPC is in room
   look
   talk <npc name exactly as shown>

PROBLEM: Commands not recognized
SOLUTION: Check command set loaded
   @py self.cmdset.all()
   Should show CharacterCmdSet

PROBLEM: Stats not updating
SOLUTION: Verify character class set
   @py self.db.character_class
   @py self.set_class("prophet")

====================
FINAL NOTES:
====================

This Biblical Fantasy MUD is a fully functional game ready for play and expansion. The foundation is solid with working room navigation, item system, NPC dialogue, character progression, and combat framework.

Floor 1 demonstrates the complete gameplay loop:
- Exploration and discovery
- NPC interaction and dialogue
- Item collection and usage
- Safe room sanctuary
- Boss encounter and progression

The modular architecture makes expansion straightforward:
- Add rooms to world_data.py
- Add items to items.py
- Add NPCs to npcs.py
- Run build script to populate

All systems are designed to scale to support the full 7-floor vision while maintaining the biblical theme and educational value.

The game successfully combines classic MUD gameplay with modern Python architecture, creating an accessible platform for both players and developers.
